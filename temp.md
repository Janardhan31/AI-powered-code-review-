❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){return a + b;}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ The function `sum` attempts to add `a` and `b` without them being defined within the function's scope. This will
likely result in an error because `a` and `b` are undefined.
* ❌ The function does not accept any arguments, which makes it inflexible. It can only work if `a` and `b` are defined
in the global scope, which is bad practice.
* ❌ There is no return type definition
* ❌ Missing semicolon at the end of the function.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
/**
* Adds two numbers together.
*
* @param {number} a The first number.
* @param {number} b The second number.
* @returns {number} The sum of a and b.
*/
function sum(a: number, b: number): number {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔ Accepts two arguments, `a` and `b`, making the function reusable with different values.
* ✔ Includes JSDoc comments to explain the purpose of the function, its parameters, and the return value. This enhances
readability and maintainability.
* ✔ No external dependencies
